Color Triggers are used to change the settings of a Color Channel. It works the same way as the normal color selection, which was covered in the Select Color section.

The "Color ID" field refers to what Color Channel you want to edit. You can click the "+" button for more options, such as the Background Color.

If you wish to change a Color Channel to the player's colors, you can use "Player Color 1" or "Player Color 2".

The "Blending" option applies blending to the color, which makes it multiply with the colors below it.

By enabling the "Copy Color" option, you can copy the color of a different Color Channel. The Color Channel you wish to copy is input in the "Channel ID" field. You can change attributes of the color you copy by using the "Hue", "Saturation", and "Brightness" sliders.

You can use the "Copy" and "Paste" buttons to copy the color from one Color Trigger to another. By clicking the "Default" button, it will automatically show the color the corresponding Color Channel has in the Select Color screen.
