## Visibility Link
This makes every object in a Group ID visible, as long as any of its objects are on screen. It is useful for larger collection of blocks that go offscreen often. Note that it cannot be toggled throughout the level.

- **Group ID:** The objects you want to be fully visible. This is processed at level load.
