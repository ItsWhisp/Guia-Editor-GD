## Collision
Spawns a Group ID when two Collision Blocks collide. One of the two blocks must have the "Dynamic Block" activated.

- **BlockA ID/BlockB ID:** Groups of Block 1 and Block 2, one of which has to have the "Dynamic Block" option enabled.
- **Target ID:** The Group ID that gets spawned when the blocks collide.
- **P1/P2/PP:** Enabling "P1" or "P2" allows triggering upon Player 1 or 2 colliding with "BlockB ID" respectively. Enabling both options allows for triggering when either player collides with it. "PP" triggers the Group ID when both players collide with each other in Dual Mode.
- **Activate Group:** Activates the Group ID. By default, the Group ID will be toggled off. Enable this option if you want to spawn a Group ID or toggle an object on.
- **Trigger On Exit:** The Group ID will be triggered when the blocks do not collide anymore.
