## Bulge
Bulges the screen.

- **Bulge:** How much the screen will bulge.
- **Radius:** How large the bulge circle is.
- **Screen OffX/Screen OffY:** Offsets the center of the bulge. Negative numbers offset it to the left or bottom respectively, while positive numbers offset it to the right or up respectively.
- **FadeTime:** Time for the effect to apply fully. The bulge will zoom in and out instead of fading in.
- **Target:** Uses a Group ID as the center the bulge zooms from. The Group ID can only consist of one object.
