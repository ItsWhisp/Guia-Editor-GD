## Counter Label

Displays Item IDs, Timers, or Points.

- **ItemID:** The Item ID that should be displayed. The value of Item IDs can be changed with Pickup Triggers, Time Triggers or Collectables depending on what option you choose.
- **Time Counter:** Functions as a Timer. You need a Time Trigger to use this Timer.
- **Seconds Only:** The Timer only displays the seconds.
- **MainTime:** Also functions as a Timer that displays the exact game time.
- **Points:** Points can be configured in the "Edit Special" page of Collectables.
- **Attempts:** Displays the current attempt the player is on.
- **Left Align/Right Align:** Aligns the ID to the left or right border respectively. The width will change depending on what value it has (for example 8 is wider than 1). By default, the width will be extended the same to the left and right. Choosing "Left Align", the width will expand only to the right, while choosing "Right Align" will expand only to the left.
