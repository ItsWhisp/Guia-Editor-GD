## Time Control
Time Control Triggers can start and stop a Timer.

- **ItemID:** The Item ID you want to use as a Timer. Place the "0" object and click "Edit Special" to configure a unique Item ID. Note that you have to set the Item ID to "Time Counter" in the "Edit Special" page of the Item ID for this Trigger to work.
