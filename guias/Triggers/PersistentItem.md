## Persistent Item
This Trigger marks Item IDs as persistent. Persistent Item IDs do not get reset when you die. However, they are reset when you exit the level.

- **Item ID:** The Item ID you want to mark as persistent. Note that if your Item ID is a Timer, you have to select the "Timer" option to the right of "Item ID".
- **Persistent:** Marks the ID as persistent, so the value will not be reset upon death.
- **TargetAll:** Targets all persistent Item IDs at once.
- **Reset:** Resets the Item ID to 0.
