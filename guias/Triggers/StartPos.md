## Start Pos
This Trigger is used to set a custom starting location of the player for playtesting. Levels cannot be verified if they include a Start Pos Trigger.

The "Speed" and "Mode" options are used to set the Speed and Game Mode to use from the Trigger. The "Options" menu features more settings, such as starting in Mini Mode, Dual Mode, or Rotated Gameplay.

The "Reset Camera" option resets all prior camera settings.

"Target Order" and "Target Channel" refer to the "Order" and "Channel" options found in the Edit Group menu. They are used to activate Gameplay Objects and Triggers in a specific order.

You can temporarily disable a Start Pos by enabling the "Disable" option.
