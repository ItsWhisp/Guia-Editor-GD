## Pinch
Pinches the screen. Works in the opposite way of the Bulge Trigger.

- **TargetX/TargetY:** How much the screen gets pinched on the X-axis and Y-axis respectively. The smaller the number, the smaller the pinch.
- **Screen OffX/Screen OffY:** Offsets the pinch center. Negative numbers offset it to the left or bottom respectively, while positive numbers offset it to the right or up respectively.
- **Radius:** The radius of the circle.
- **Modifier:** Modifies all values. All values will be multiplied with the value you put here.
- **FadeTime:** Time for the effect to apply fully. The pinch will zoom in and out instead of fading in.
