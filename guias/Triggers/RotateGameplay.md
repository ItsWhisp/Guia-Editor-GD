## Rotate Gameplay
Rotates the gameplay (not the camera) in the direction the arrow points. The line that is below the arrow indicates the gravity. The Rotate Gameplay Trigger direction determines how the Channelâ€™s Triggers are sorted. For example, if the Rotate Gameplay Trigger points up, Triggers with a smaller Y value are triggered first, and higher ones later. If the Trigger points right, Triggers with a smaller X value are triggered first and higher ones later, and so on. See Channel System for more information.

- **Keep Velocity:** Keeps the velocity the player has before the gameplay rotation and smoothly transitions it to the new gravity. Results in smoother movement overall.
- **Change Channel:** Changes the Channel to the number you have entered in the number box at the bottom.
- **Channel Only:** Only changes the Channel and does not update the gameplay rotation.
- **Instant Offset:** The camera updates instantly when switching gameplay to the opposite direction.
