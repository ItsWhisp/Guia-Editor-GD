- **Channel:** With "Channel", you pulse an entire Color Channel. Clicking the "+" button allows you to select a special color. This includes for example the Background, Ground, Middleground, and Player Colors.
- **Group:** With "Group", you pulse objects with that Group ID.
- **Main Only and Secondary Only:** These options are only available when clicking "Group". Some objects have a Base Color and Detail Color, which can be seen in the "Edit Object" menu.
- **Color:** With "Color", the objects pulse the color you select.
- **HSV:** With "HSV", you can pulse the objects using another "Color ID" and change the "Hue", "Saturation" and "Brightness" of that "Color ID". If you leave this value at 0, you pulse the color you put into the "Channel ID" field
- **Fade In:** The duration for the objects to reach the pulse color.
- **Hold:** How long the objects hold the pulse color.
- **Fade Out:** The duration for the objects to return to their original color.
- **Exclusive:** This option disables all other pulses with the same ID, and only plays the current pulse.
