## TimeWarp
Speeds up or slows down time. This affects everything, including player movement, durations in Triggers, Timers, and so on.

- **TimeMod:** Modifier for the time. The value you input here will be multiplied with the normal time, so less than 1 will slow the time down and above 1 will speed time up.
