## Time Event
Time Event Triggers spawn a Group ID if a specific time is hit in the Timer. Unlike the "TargetID" in the Time Trigger, the Timer does not have to stop at this value to Trigger it.

- **ItemID:** The Item ID you want to use as a Timer. Place the "0" object and click "Edit Special" to configure a unique Item ID. Note that you have to set the Item ID to "Time Counter" in the "Edit Special" page of the Item ID for this Trigger to work.
- **TargetID:** The Group ID you want to spawn when "TargetTime" is hit
- **TargetTime:** The time at which you want to spawn "TargetID".
- **Multi Activate:** The Triggers can spawn again if the "TargetTime" is hit several times.
