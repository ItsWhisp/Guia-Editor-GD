## BPM Guide
Draws lines in the editor at beats per minute you configure. Helps to make parts sync based on the BPM the song uses.

- **BPM:** Stands for beats per minute. Lines will be drawn based on this number. For example, if you have 60 BPM, a line will be drawn every second.
- **BPB:** Stands for beats per bar. One bar is the space between two BPM lines. The number you input here will split each space into the corresponding sections. For example, if you have a BPM of 60 and a BPB of 2, a line will be drawn every 0.5 seconds.
- **Duration:** How long you want the lines to be drawn.
- **Speed:** Changes the distance between the lines to account for the different speeds.
- **Disable:** Hides the lines
