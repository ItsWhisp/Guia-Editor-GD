## Random
Randomly triggers one of two Group IDs

- **Group ID 1/Group ID 2:** The two Group IDs that can be triggered.
- **Chance %:** The chance that "Group ID 1" is triggered. For example, if this is set to 80, "Group ID 1" has an 80% chance of being triggered, while "Group ID 2" has a chance of 100% - 80% = 20%.
