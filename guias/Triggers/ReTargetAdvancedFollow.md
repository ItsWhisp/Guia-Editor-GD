# Re-Target Advanced Follow
This Trigger is used to change the target of an Advanced Follow Trigger.

- **Target GID:** The Group ID of the objects that should go towards the Group ID set in "Follow GID".
- **Follow GID:** The Group ID of the object that should be the new target. You can choose from the buttons below for more options.
- **Target Control ID:** Control ID allows you to only target a specific Group ID when using remapping. For example, if you remap a Spawn Trigger to use Group ID 1, 2, and 3, and you only want to target Group ID 3, you can enter a Control ID and enable the option in the Trigger. You can find the Control ID option in the "Extra 2" category after clicking "Edit Group" with the Trigger selected.
- **P1/P2/C:** Corresponds to Player 1, Player 2, and the screen center respectively.
