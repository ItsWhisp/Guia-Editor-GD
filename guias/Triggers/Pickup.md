# Pickup
Pickup Triggers can be used to change the values of Item IDs.
- **Item ID:** The Item ID you want to check the value for. Place the "0" object and click "Edit Special" to configure a unique Item ID.
- **Count:** The number you want to increase the current Item ID value by. By default, this will use addition. Check the options below for different arithmetics.
- **Override:** The Item ID value will override the current value with the new one instead of using addition.
- **Multiply:** Multiplies the previous value with your set modifier.
- **Divide:** Divides the previous value with your set modifier. Note that the Item ID will drop all numbers after the decimal point. For example, dividing a value of 5 by 2 will result in 2 instead of 2.5, since the 0.5 is dropped.
