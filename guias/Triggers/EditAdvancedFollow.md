# Edit Advanced Follow
This Trigger is used to edit the attributes of an Advanced Follow Trigger. An explanation of all options can be found below.

- **Target GID:** The Group ID of the objects that should go towards the "Follow GID".
- **X Only/Y Only:** The objects will only apply the change on the X or Y movement respectively.
- **Mod X/Mod Y:** Modifies the movement on the X-axis and Y-axis respectively.
- **Speed:** Modifies the speed of the objects.
- **Dir:** Modifies the direction at which the movement is applied.
- **Target Control ID:** Control ID allows you to only target a specific Group ID when using remapping. For example, if you remap a Spawn Trigger to use Group ID 1, 2, and 3, and you only want to target Group ID 3, you can enter a Control ID and enable the option in the Trigger. You can find the Control ID option in the "Extra 2" category after clicking "Edit Group" with the Trigger selected.
- **Redirect Dir:** Redirects the direction towards a reference object, which is input in the box to the right.

The two boxes on the right correspond to their respective options. They apply their setting towards a reference object. "Speed" functions like a multiplier in this setting. It will copy the movement speed of the reference object. By inputting a 2 in the slider, you double the speed. "Dir" will apply the movement towards the direction of the reference object.
