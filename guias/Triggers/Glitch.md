- **FadeTime:** Time for the effect to apply fully.
- **Strength:** Strength of the effect. All other values will be multiplied with the strength and adjusted accordingly.
- **Speed:** Speed at which the glitch effects happen. The lower the value, the slower the effects.
- **SliceHeight:** During the glitch effect the screen will be sliced, which refers to the higher blocks getting offset on the X-axis.
- **MaxSliceXOff:** Max offset on the X-axis that the objects can be sliced.
- **MaxColXOff/MaxColYOff:** Max distance offset for the color on the X-axis and Y-axis respectively.
