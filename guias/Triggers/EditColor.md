## Edit Color
Edits the color of the screen.

- **FadeTime:** Time for the effect to apply fully.
- **CR/CG/CB:** Stands for color red, green and blue. Tints the screen in the corresponding color, with 1 being no tint. The smaller the value, the more of that color is used.
- **BR/BG/BB:** Brightness red, green and blue. Works like the "Brightness" slider in the "HSV" menu when editing colors.
