## Follow
This Trigger is used to make objects mimic the movement of other objects. All options are explained below.

- **Target Group ID:** The objects you want to follow another Group ID.
- **Follow Group ID:** The Group ID that should be followed. This Group ID can only consist of a single object.
- **Move Time:** How long you want the objects to follow the Group ID.
- **X/Y Mod:** The values you put here will be multiplied with the movement of the "Follow Group ID". For example, if the "Follow Group ID" moves 50 blocks to the right, and you put 0.5 in "X Mod", the objects move 25 blocks to the right instead of 50
