## Camera Edge
Sets edges for the camera. If the edge is within the current screen, it will either snap for the object to be at the edge or ignore it until the object is outside the screen, depending on the zoom level. The camera edge will adjust with the movement of the edge objects.

- **Target ID:** The Group ID you want to set as the edge. It can only consist of a single object.
- **Left/Right/Up/Down:** Defines what kind of edge it is. Enabling left would set the object as the left edge of the screen, while down would set it at the bottom edge of the screen, and so on.
- **Unlock:** Press this button to return to the default state. You can also just leave "Target ID" at 0.
