## Shader
Shader Triggers edit how the other Shader Triggers work. You can disable shader effects and limit the layers they affect.

- **Disable All:** Disables all other shaders.
- **No Player Particles:** When using a shader which only affects the player layer, the particles might look weird due to different rendering. This option disables the shader from the particles.

With the buttons at the bottom, you can choose the layers affected by the shaders. The blue buttons are the highest and lowest layer that will be affected. The green buttons are the ones in between which will be affected, and the gray ones will not be affected
