## Pixelate
Pixelates the screen.

- **TargetX/TargetY:** How much the screen will pixelate on the X-axis and Y-axis respectively. You have to enable the "Use X" and/or "Use Y" option for the distance to apply.
- **FadeTime:** Time for the effect to apply fully.
- **Snap Grid:** Snaps the pixels to the grid. Without this option, the pixels will smear a little when the player moves.
