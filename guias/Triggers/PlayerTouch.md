## Player Touch
Toggles or spawns a Group ID if the player clicks while within the block hitbox.

- **Group ID:** The Group ID that gets spawned or toggled when the Trigger gets activated.
- **Activate Group:** Activates the Group ID. By default, the Group ID will be toggled off. Enable this option if you want to spawn a Group ID or toggle an object on.
- **Claim Touch:** The player will not jump and no rings will spawn. The click can not be buffered.
- **Spawn Only:** Clicking only spawns the Group ID and does not toggle it on or off.
- **NO Multi Activate:** By default, the Group ID will be toggled or spawned every time you click within the hitbox. With this option enabled, you can only toggle or spawn it once.
