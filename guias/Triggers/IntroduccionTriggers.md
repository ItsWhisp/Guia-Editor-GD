## Triggers

### Description

There are over a hundred Triggers in the game. These are found in the second to last tab, seen below. As explained earlier, Triggers are used to perform various complex actions. They may alter visible objects, such as blocks, in some way, or just change the gameplay or visuals. Since they work in this way, they are never visible objects that can be seen when playing a level. You place them in the editor, and they do their action when the player passes the Trigger's position or other linked events. For example, Triggers that have the "Touch Trigger" option enabled will be triggered when the player touches them. There is also a "Spawn Trigger" option, which means it is spawned by a Spawn Trigger or different conditional Triggers, like Touch Triggers, Count Triggers, Time Triggers, and more.

Below this, every Trigger is covered in-depth in order. If you are unsure about the name of a Trigger found in-game, you can find it by looking at the title inside Edit Object. This is also where you will edit a Trigger's settings. Note that you can also find some simple quick help there by clicking the information button (shown as an "i" in one of the corners). This guide works best as an additional resource if any of that text is unclear. Previous knowledge in this document, such as Edit Group, is expected to be able to work with Triggers well.
