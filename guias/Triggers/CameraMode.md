## Camera Mode
Allows switching between Free Mode and Normal Mode for camera. In Free Mode, the borders for Ship, Ball, UFO, Wave, Spider, and Swing are removed.

- **Edit Camera Settings:** Allows you to edit how the camera follows the player in Free Mode. "Easing" changes how the camera starts and ends its movement, while "Padding" modifies how close the player has to be to the top or bottom of the screen for the camera to start following.
- **Disable GridSnap:** Normally the camera center will snap to the closest grid space. With this option enabled, the snapping will not happen.
