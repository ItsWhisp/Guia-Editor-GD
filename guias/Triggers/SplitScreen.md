## Split Screen
Splits the screen in identical sections.

- **TargetX/TargetY:** How many sections the screen gets split in the X-axis and Y-axis respectively. The number you input here gets one more added, so with "TargetX" at 1 you split the screen in 2 sections. You have to enable the "Use X" and/or "Use Y" option respectively to split the screen.
- **FadeTime:** Time for the effect to apply fully.
- **Easing:** Easing options change the way the movements start and end their transitions
