## End

- **SpawnID:** A Group ID that gets spawned when the player reaches the end. This is optional.
- **Instant:** The player will teleport to the end as soon as the object is on screen instead of slowly jumping towards it.
- **No Effects:** Disables the effects that play when you reach the end, such as the effect lines.
- **No SFX:** Disables the SFX that plays when you reach the end.
