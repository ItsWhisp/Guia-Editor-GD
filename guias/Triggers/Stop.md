# Stop

This Trigger shows as a Stop, Pause or Resume Trigger depending on what option you choose inside "Edit Object"

"Stop" is used to stop the action of other Triggers permanently. Give the Triggers you want to stop a Group ID and enter that Group ID in the Stop Trigger.

"Pause" pauses the action of other Triggers temporarily. Give the Triggers you want to pause a Group ID and enter that Group ID in the Stop Trigger. The difference to a Stop Trigger is that you can resume the Trigger later by using a Resume Trigger.

"Resume" resumes the action of other Triggers. Give the Triggers you want to resume a Group ID and enter that Group ID in the Stop Trigger. Only Triggers that were paused with a Pause Trigger can be resumed.

"Use Control ID" allows you to only stop a specific Group ID when using remapping. For example, if you remap a Spawn Trigger to use Group IDs 1, 2, and 3, and you only want to stop Group ID 3, you can enter a "Control ID" and enable the option in the Stop Trigger. You can find the "Control ID" option in the "Extra 2" category after clicking "Edit Group".
