## Event
Spawns a Group ID upon a player action. The action can be selected from the top right menu.

- **Group ID:** The Group ID that is spawned when the player does the action.
- **Extra ID/Extra ID2:** You can input a Material ID here for the action to only apply if you are on that Material ID. For example, if you choose "Normal Landing" and enter a Material ID used for a specific a block, you will only activate the Group ID if you land on that block.
