## Enter Triggers
Lets you create custom Enter Effects, similar to the default ones above. Due to
these having many of the same settings, we will be explaining them all first
and only mention specific ones below. Note that one block is equal to 30 for
all of these.

Length: Distance from the screen borders where the effect is applied.
- Offset: Offsets the screen borders. Enter a positive value to offset it to the
right, and a negative value to offset it to the left.
- Enter Channel: Used similarly to Group IDs. The objects you want to have
the Enter Effect can be set with "Enter Channel" under "Extra2" in "Edit
Group".
- Effect ID: Specific ID that can be referenced later, for example in Stop
Enter Effect Triggers.
- Enter Only/Exit Only: The effect is only applied on screen entrance or exit
respectively.
- Easing: Modifies how the objects start and end their transitions.
