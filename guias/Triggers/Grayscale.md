## Gray Scale
Adds a grayscale filter to the screen.

- **Target:** Percentage of grayscale that is applied. For example, with 0.5 the screen will tint 50% gray.
- **FadeTime:** Time for the effect to apply fully.
- **Tint Channel:** Tints the screen in a Color Channel instead of gray.
- **UseLum:** Refers to luminosity, which is a different way to convert color to grayscale. Luminosity forms a weighted average to account for human perception. The formula for luminosity is 0.21\*R + 0.72\*G + 0.07\*B.
- **Easing:** Easing options change the way the colors start and end their transitions.
