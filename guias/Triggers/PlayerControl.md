## Player Control
Controls behavior of the player.

- **P1/P2:** What player you want to control. Both options enabled or disabled results in both players being affected.
- **Stop Jump:** Stops the player jumping.
- **Stop Move:** Stops the player movement.
- **Stop Rot:** Stops the player rotation.
- **Stop Slide:** Stops the low friction state you are in after being launched by a force block. It does not stop the sliding from slopes or ice blocks.
