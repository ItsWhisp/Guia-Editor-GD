## Shock Line
Creates a shock line effect.

- **Speed:** The speed at which the shockline will happen.
- **Strength:** How strong the shockline is. The lower the value, the less distorted objects get.
- **Thickness:** The thickness of each line. The higher the value, the thicker the wave will be.
- **WaveW:** Line width. The higher the value, the less distorted it is.
- **FadeIn/FadeOut:** Fades the shockline in and out. The higher the value, the longer it takes to fade in or out respectively.
- **TimeOff:** Time offset before the shockline starts with the value being in seconds.
- **MaxSize:** Modifies the max size of the line. Leaving it at 0 will put it at the max value. The value you put here will be multiplied with the line size.
- **Invert:** Inverts the shockline. If considered in a 3D perspective, the highs of the line will become lows and the other way around.
- **Flip:** Flips the line to go from right to left instead of left to right.
- **Rotate:** Rotates the line to go from bottom to top instead of left to right.
- **Dual:** Creates two shock lines from the middle, which go to the left and right respectively.
- **Target:** Chooses a Group ID as the center of the shockline. The Group ID can only consist of one object.
- **P1/P2:** Makes Player 1 or Player 2 respectively the center of the shockline. Option only available with "Target" enabled.
- **Relative:** The shockline follows the screen movement. By default, it will stay at the position it was triggered at.
- **ScreenOff:** Offsets the center of the shockline. Negative numbers offset it to the left or bottom respectively, while positive numbers offset it to the right or up respectively. Note that the directions depend on what option you choose from the buttons above.
