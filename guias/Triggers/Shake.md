## Shake
The Shake Trigger applies a temporary shake effect to the screen. Be careful to not overuse this Trigger or input large numbers into the options, as it may result in a bad experience for players. The options are explained below.

- **Strength:** How intense the shake effect is.
- **Interval:** The interval between every shake effect. Leaving this value at 0 results in the screen shaking every frame.
- **Duration:** How long the shake effect is applied to the screen.
