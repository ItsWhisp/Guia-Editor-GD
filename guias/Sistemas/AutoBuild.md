## Auto-Build System
The Auto-Build System allows you to create designs from a premade template. This makes it particularly useful to speed up block design creation. However, the system can also be used across levels, making it work well for 3D lines, layouts, and more too. To get started, place one of the last 3 objects in the Blocks tab (first tab under "Build") in the editor. These are called Smart-Blocks. Afterwards, click "Edit Special" to open the following menu:

*Figure 11.1: The initial page with default settings.*<br>

We will be going through all the settings by creating several examples. First, we will use premade templates to achieve some basic designs. Then, we will set up our own templates for more complex designs and use the system to generate random Spike designs.

We start by creating a new template. To do this, go to the "Browser" tab. It should look like figure 11.2 when you first open it. Click the "New" button and enter a name to create a new template.

*Figure 11.2: The "Browser" tab when first opened.*<br>

*Figure 11.3: Creating a new template.*<br>

You will see information about our template below the name. "Defined" refers to how many different templates we have created. "Variations" refers to how many variations our designs have. The "46" refers to the default template blocks, which we will use in our first example to create a block design.

Click the "Browse" button to see all premade Smart-Block templates, as seen in figure 11.4. By clicking on a template, you can add it to the editor. The amount of templates you add does not matter, but by creating all 46 premade ones, you ensure your template is functional for simple structures. For our example, we will design all templates

*Figure 11.5: All premade templates pasted in the editor.*<br>

We can now start creating our design on the template. Blocks with dashed outlines function as references. You fill out the solid outline blocks as if the reference blocks were in your design. See the figure below.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/195.png)
*Figure 11.6: How the design should change based on the reference blocks.*<br>

You can build your design across different layers. Additionally, you can add details up to 1 block space outside of the Smart-Block. After finishing every design, we have the result in figure 11.7.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/196.png)
*Figure 11.7: Our finished designs.*<br>

Now that we have finished our design, we want to update our template to include our decoration. Select everything you have created, as well as the Smart-Blocks. Go into the "Browser" tab again and ensure you use your template. After doing so, click the blue "Template" button on the initial page.

*Figure 11.8: Updating the template with our designs.*<br>

If you return to the screen from which we copied the premade templates, our new designs can now be seen, as shown below.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/198.png)
*Figure 11.9: Template updated with your designs.*<br>

With that, we have created our first template. We now want to test it by generating the design for custom structures. To do so, build structures using the Smart-Blocks, as seen in figure 11.10. After doing so, select all the Smart-Blocks, open the system's menu from "Edit Special", and click the "Create" button. This gives the result in figure 11.11.

*Figure 11.10: Structure created with Smart-Blocks.*<br>

*Figure 11.11: The same structure filled out with the Auto-Build System.*<br>

We can automatically fill any Smart-Block structures with our template design. It can also be used across levels if we wish to reuse it at any point.

Even though the premade templates worked well for our structures, we are still limited in what we can create. Because of this, we now want to add to our template and expand it with new structures and slopes. Click the "Create All" button to paste all of your templates so far. Click "Paste Template" to see the first structure we want to expand. As you can see, the template does not create the designs correctly, as seen in figure 11.12. We now recreate our design in the new structures to be correct, as seen in figure 11.13.

*Figure 11.13: Structures with incorrect designs fixed.*<br>

We created these structures like new templates. We now also want to add slopes to our templates. To do this, we can make our own templates to decorate. To create your own templates, use the Smart-Blocks to create the structures you need. With more variations, your result gets more precise.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/203.png)
*Figure 11.14: Slope Template.*<br>

You would usually have to create versions for all rotations of the slopes. However, by enabling "Allow Rotation", "Allow Flip X", and "Allow Flip Y" in the main menu, seen below, one version is enough.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/204.png)
*Figure 11.15: Auto-Build System with new settings enabled.*<br>

We can now fill the slopes with our design. Like with the premade templates, we can place details up to 1 block space outside the Smart-Blocks.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/205.png)
*Figure 11.16: Slope template filled out with designs.*<br>

Let us create a new template now with all the new templates added. Like before, go to the "Browser" tab and create a new template. Use it, select all designs along with their Smart-Blocks, and click "Template". The Auto-Build System will deconstruct our slopes into singular blocks, as shown in figure 10.17. With that, we have finished our second template.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/206.png)
*Figure 11.17: New templates added to the template browser.*<br>

Templates can have several variations, indicated by a small number on the templates, as seen in figure 11.18. Variations can have different odds of being used, which can create more details. In our third and final example, we want to create a template that generates unique configurations of Spikes on the ground.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/207.png)
*Figure 11.18: A template having several variations.*<br>

We first decide what Spike variations we want to use. The best way to achieve this is to create all the variations we want in the editor as follows

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/208.png)
*Figure 11.19: All spike variations we want to use.*<br>

As you can see, the Spikes always start and end with the same Spikes. We also want our Spikes to be variable in length and only have the corner Spikes at the start and end. To achieve this, we will be using reference blocks. Reference blocks indicate that a variation gets used if another Smart-Block is at the location of the reference block. We can use this to set up our templates, as shown in figure 11.21. The left corner Spike requires another Spike to the right of it, while the right corner Spike requires another Spike to the left of it. (You mark a Smart-Block as a reference by clicking the "Reference Only" option, as shown in figure 11.20.)

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/209.png)
*Figure 11.20: Marking a Smart-Block as a reference block.*<br>

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/210.png)
*Figure 11.21: Using reference blocks for the corners of the spike design.*<br>

For our other Spikes, we require another Spike to the left and the right of each. We can use the reference blocks to indicate this by placing one to the left and one to the right of our Smart-Block. Using the same templates six times for all our Spike variations leaves us with the result shown in figure 11.22

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/211.png)
*Figure 11.22: All spikes put into templates.*<br>

We now create a new template, and update it with the templates we created. The template browser should show our corner Spikes and one of the other six Spikes with a small "6" on it.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/212.png)
*Figure 11.23: Template browser view with our spikes added.*<br>

You can click on the Spike template to view all variations, as seen in figure 11.24. Right now, none of the variations have the odds to appear. To change this, click all variations and hit the "Add" button.

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/213.png)
*Figure 11.24: The variations tab.*<br>

![](https://guia.editorgd.xyz/assets/img/figures/214.png)
*Figure 11.25: Variations having different odds.*<br>

Doing so has made the odds of each appear below the respective variation. Currently, every variation has a one in six chance. For our example, we want the fifth variation to be rarer than the others and the third to be more likely. To do this, we first deselect variation five and click "Add" to increase their odds. After that, we deselect all besides variation three and click "Add". This process changes the odds of the selected variations appropriately

Now, all the odds should have changed accordingly. We can now place Smart-Blocks and click "Create" to generate unique variations of ground Spikes, with each Spike having different odds, the length being variable, and the corner Spikes always at the correct position. Figure 11.26 shows some examples.
