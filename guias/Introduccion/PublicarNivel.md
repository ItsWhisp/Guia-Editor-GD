## Sharing Your Level

### Verifying
Once you are finished with your level, you have to verify it before you can publish it. This means that you have to beat your level by clicking "Save and Play" in the Pause Menu. You can also click the play button from the Level Menu (figure 13.1). It must be an attempt from the start of the level, so a Start Position cannot be used. If your level has any User Coins, these must also be collected. Note that you can collect the User Coins on different attempts, as long as all lead to you beating the level. For example, if your level has 2 User Coins, you can collect the first in one attempt, and then the second in another attempt.

### Level Menu
After successfully verifying your level (and its potential User Coins), head out of the level and go to the Level Menu, seen in figure 13.1. As you can see, it says that the status is "Verified" on the bottom right. This means that you are ready to upload your level.

The other text gives various other details about the level. To the left is the level's length if the Game Type is Classic: 0-10 seconds is "Tiny", 10-30 seconds is "Short", 30-60 seconds is "Medium", 60-120 seconds is "Long", and 120+ seconds is "XL" (for Extra Long). If the level is Platformer, this will simply say "Plat." since these levels' length cannot be determined easily. In the middle is the starting song, and below that is the version and ID (once shared).

On the right are buttons for various actions. First is deleting the local editor level. This action cannot be undone, so only use this if you are certain. Below that is a button that opens this guide. Third is a button to make another editor copy of the level, and finally is a button to move the level to the top of your editor levels (indicated by the arrow). Clicking this will put the level at the top in the list seen by clicking the back arrow in the top left. To organize this list better, you can put your level into a specific folder, indicated by the folder with a "0" on the left side of the menu. The information button in the bottom left shows various statistics about your level.

Before sharing your level, putting in a title and description at the top is most important. The title of a level cannot be updated once it is shared. You would have to reupload a new copy with a new name. However, the description can easily be changed. Note that writing one is optional.

### Uploading
Once you have set a title you are satisfied with, click the third big button. This opens the level sharing interface, which is shown below. Here, the name and description is shown at the top. Below that, you can select how many Stars or Moons you want to request. To decide this accurately, we recommend playing levels on the Featured tab and getting an idea of the difficulty of rated levels. Note that you can skip choosing one without any problems later

In the top right, indicated by the gear, are some extra settings. Clicking this opens the menu seen in figure 13.3. Here, you can choose whether you want to allow users to copy your level into their editor or not. You can also check "Requires Password" to require users to input a password from 4 to 6 numbers long to copy it.

There is also an option for "Unlisted", which means that your level does not show on any level lists or general search results. This means that it will not show on your profile either. For users to find it, they must search the exact ID. On top of being unlisted, you can also enable "Friends Only", which means a user must be your friend and search the exact ID to find it. You can, for example, enable these options alongside "Allow Copy" to share a level to a friend you want to collaborate with.

Once you are happy with all these settings, go ahead and click "Share Level". This will upload your level to the servers if there are no issues. On the Level Menu, the ID field will now be updated with your level's ID. This can be shared with others to help them find your level. To see how your level looks on the servers, head back to your list of editor levels seen below.

*Figure 13.4: List of your editor levels.*<br>

Here, click the button in the bottom left (marked in red) to see your published levels. Your recently published level shows at the top. Clicking it takes you to its level page seen below. Here you can play it, see comments and the Level Leaderboards, and more.

*Figure 13.5: Published level page.*<br>

The two buttons on the left, marked in pink, may be useful in some cases. First is a button that removes your level from the server entirely. The button in the top right of this page only deletes it from your saved levels, but it can still be found by others. Secondly is another copy button, which is always enabled for the creator of a level (regardless of the copying options set earlier). This is useful if you no longer have a local editor copy of your level.

### Updating Levels
The easiest way to update an uploaded level is to make edits on the local editor copy. This will change its status from "Uploaded" to "Unverified", and the version number also says 2 instead of 1. Once done with your edits, go through the process of verifying again, and then share it as you did before. This will automatically update the online level.

If you no longer have a local editor copy of the level, copy the online level from the button seen in figure 13.5. This makes a copy with an additional number at the end of the name. If you want to use this copy to update the level, you have to edit the title of this copy to be the exact same as the online level. After that, do your edits and share it as before. This also links the update to the shared level

### Updating Descriptions
As for updating only the description and not the level content, it is also best to have the exact copy that was uploaded. Once uploaded, the copy will show a new refresh button on the left, marked in red below. This is solely used to update the description. Simply type in your new description and click it.

*Figure 13.6: Updating a description.*<br>

If you do not have the exact copy, you have to do the same as when you want to update a level by copying the published level. Unfortunately, the refresh description button will not show up in this case. You will have to verify the level again, type in your new description, and go through the sharing process. Make sure the level name is the exact same as the online level.

### Rating
After you have published a level publicly, the displayed Difficulty of the level may update. This is based on community ratings through the bottom right button in figure 13.5. Using this, players can get an idea of the Difficulty of your level. However, this does not mean the level gives any rewards when it is beaten.

Your level gives rewards if RobTop, the developer of the game, plays it and gives it a certain amount of Stars or Moons. The amount ranges from 1 to 10. Stars are rewarded for Classic levels, while Moons are rewarded for Platformer levels. These show below the Difficulty face on the level page or level lists. Once rated, the Difficulty is locked and community votes are no longer available. These are the Star and Moon values for each Difficulty:

- **Auto:** 1 Star or Moon
- **Easy:** 2 Stars or Moons
- **Normal:** 3 Stars or Moons
- **Hard:** 4 to 5 Stars or Moons
- **Harder:** 6 to 7 Stars or Moons
- **Insane:** 8 to 9 Stars or Moons
- **Demon:** 10 Stars or Moons

Within Demon levels, there is an additional separation into Easy, Medium, Hard, Insane, and Extreme Demons in order of increasing difficulty. This is solely based on community votes on levels already rated Demon by RobTop. Getting a higher Demon rating does not change the reward, only the Difficulty Face shown on the level.

If a player beats a Rated level, the amount of Stars or Moons are added to their profile statistics. If the level has User Coins, a rating may also involve verifying these so that they show on a user's profile when collected. This is the case if they are done properly as explained here.

There are no specific guidelines to ensure your level gets a rating. It is simply about whether RobTop likes it or not. However, some general tips are:

- At least 30 seconds in length
- Overall clear gameplay
- Decent visuals
- Optimized performance

Additionally, how much RobTop likes it results in various types of ratings. This is indicated by an additional effect around the Difficulty Face, which is seen below. From left to right, we have Rated, Featured, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic. Each gives 1 more Creator Point than the last, which is a statistic shown on profiles and the Creators Leaderboard to highlight creators.

*Figure 13.7: The different types of ratings.*<br>

One way to increase the chances of your level being rated is by requesting it to a Moderator. Moderators are players that can suggest high-quality levels to RobTop for a rating. They are indicated by a special "M" badge on their in-game profile.
