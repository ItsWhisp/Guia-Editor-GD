## Custom Objects
As mentioned earlier, you can create your own sets of Custom Objects, which can be used across different levels. Custom Objects are in the last tab in the "Build" category.

From left to right, the buttons indicate moving a Custom Object design up and down a position, adding a new Custom Object, and deleting an existing one. To add a Custom Object, first create the design. For example:

*Figure 8.2: Custom Orb decoration.*<br>

Now select all of the objects in your design, and click the "+" button to add them as a Custom Object. Your design should appear as a new button in the Custom Objects tab, as seen in figure 8.3.

You can now select the Custom Object and place it in the editor whenever you wish. Custom Objects can consist of up to 1000 objects, and you can add up to 200 unique Custom Objects. Select a Custom Object and click the "â€“" button to delete it, as shown in figure 8.4. Note that this action cannot be undone.
